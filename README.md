[The design I'm working with](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1380305920742671237)


## Why and what?

This is a personal project that combines various tools and features I've built over the year and plan on building. It's intended for personal (as in, for me) use.Openly building because there arenâ€™t many SQLite Turso references available with this stack. It's my way of figuring out how non-document/object databases work and implementing server actions and API route handlers and most important, doing what I love.

<span style="font-size:5px;">Currently, the component and core folder is a hot mess with a lot of unused code and bad organization, but this will be refactored sooner or later. My priorities lay on an MVP for certain features and mastering the back-end side. I know SOLID principles, but best practices will come when I have everything shaped the right direction.</span>

Settign up locally is straight forward
```bash
git clone https://github.com/remcostoeten/remcostoeten-all-in-one-dashboard.git remcostoeten-dashboard
cd remcostoeten-dashboard
cp .env.example .env.local
```
Fill in all the enviorments credentials. Not all are neccissary but some features won't work without. Another configuration file in `src/core/config/site-config.ts` to be renamed to your own likings. Running the project is as easy as 

```bash
bun i
#or npm , pnpm. I use pnpm or bun
bun dev
```
That should be it. IF you struggle with the turbo flag for some reason edit the dev command in `packages.json` to just `next-dev`
